# php-mvc-framework

This is an MVC framework I made with vanilla PHP to learn how popular MVC frameworks work.

Some features include:
- dockerized environment with the latest Nginx, PHP, Postgres, Composer images
- Twig templating for views
- show/hide custom 404 and 500 HTTP error views by changing SHOW_ERRORS .env variable
- Nginx error logging in ./docker/nginx/.logs
- PHP error logging in ./docker/php/.logs
- Postgres database
